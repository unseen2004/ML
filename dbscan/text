1. Accuracy of the Classification
Overall Cluster Purity: 74.97%
Misclassification Rate: 25.03%
2. Percentage of Noise
Noise Points: 325 out of 10,000 samples
Percentage of Noise: 3.25%
3. Percentage of Misclassifications in Clusters
Misclassification rate within clusters is directly related to the cluster purity. For example:
Cluster 0: Purity = 42.75% (high misclassification)
Cluster 1: Purity = 92.06% (low misclassification)
Cluster 5: Purity = 95.57% (very low misclassification)
4. Number of Clusters
Total Clusters: 13
The number of clusters is within the acceptable range (10â€“30).
5. Uniformity of Clusters
Most clusters are dominated by a single digit, e.g.:
Cluster 1: Dominant digit = 0, Purity = 92.06%
Cluster 3: Dominant digit = 2, Purity = 92.99%
Some clusters show lower uniformity, e.g.:
Cluster 0: Dominant digit = 4, Purity = 42.75%
6. Parameter Selection
Optimal Parameters:
eps = 0.300
min_samples = 35
